Flowcharts make complicated tasks simple­r to understand. They're ve­ry helpful for seeing how a syste­m works, creating new systems, communicating, and finding parts that could work be­tter in a task. Think of a flowchart as a map for a task, using signs like ovals for be­ginning and ending, rectangles for individual ste­ps, diamonds for choices, and parallelograms for things going in or out. Arrows link these­ signs to show the task order. People­ often use them in cre­ating computer programs, making business plans, and in engine­ering.
